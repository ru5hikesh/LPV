1. Design and implement Parallel Breadth First Search and Depth First Search based on existing 
algorithms using OpenMP. Use a Tree or an undirected graph for BFS and DFS . 
2. Write a program to implement Parallel Bubble Sort and Merge sort using OpenMP. Use 
existing algorithms and measure the performance of sequential and parallel algorithms. 
  3. Implement Min, Max, Sum and Average operations using Parallel Reduction. 
4. Write a CUDA Program for : 
1. Addition of two large vectors 
2. Matrix Multiplication using CUDA C 
5. Implement HPC application for AI/ML domain.
